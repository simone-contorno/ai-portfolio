# **Deep Learning Regression Model with Keras**

## ðŸ“Œ **Project Overview**  
This notebook is designed to practice and apply the knowledge I got from the **Introduction to Deep Learning & Neural Networks with Keras** course by IBM on Coursera. The objective is to build and experiment with a regression model using the **Keras** library and evaluate the impact of key hyperparameters such as the **number of epochs** and **hidden layers** on model performance.

Through hands-on experimentation, I deeped mine understanding of how deep learning models can be fine-tuned to optimize performance for regression tasks.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Learning Objectives**  
By completing this project, I:
- Built a **regression model** using the **Keras** deep learning library.
- **Experimented with hyperparameters** such as the number of training epochs and the number of hidden layers.
- Observed how changing these parameters impacts model performance.
  
## ðŸ›  **Technologies & Tools Used**  
- **Python**  
  - Libraries: Keras, TensorFlow, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn  
- **Jupyter Notebook** (for coding and experimentation)
