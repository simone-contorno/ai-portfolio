# **Fashion-MNIST Classification Using CNN**

## üìã **Overview**
This notebook is designed to practice and apply deep learning concepts I gained from the **Deep Learning with PyTorch** course by IBM on Coursera. It focuses on classifying the Fashion-MNIST dataset using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). 

## üéØ **Learning Objectives**
- Implement a CNN model for image classification
- Process and prepare image data for deep learning
- Create custom dataset classes in PyTorch
- Define and train neural network models
- Evaluate model performance on image classification tasks

## üõ† **Technologies & Tools Used**  
- **Python**  
  - Libraries: PyTorch, torchvision, NumPy, Matplotlib  
- **Jupyter Notebook** (for experimentation and model evaluation)  
- **Convolutional Neural Networks** (for image classification)
- **Fashion-MNIST Dataset** (for training and testing)

## üîç **Key Features**
- Implementation of a custom Dataset class for handling Fashion-MNIST data
- Data preprocessing including resizing and normalization
- CNN model architecture with convolutional layers, pooling, and fully connected layers
- Model training with softmax activation and cross-entropy loss
- Evaluation of model performance on test data
