# **Comparing VGG16 and ResNet50 for Image Classification**

## ðŸ“Œ **Project Overview**  
This notebook is designed to practice and apply deep learning concepts I gained from the **AI Capstone Project with Deep Learning** course by IBM on Coursera. The goal is to build image classifiers using transfer learning with two popular pre-trained models, **VGG16** and **ResNet50**, evaluate their performance on the same dataset, and compare their effectiveness for the classification task.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Learning Objectives**  
By completing this project, I:
- Implemented **transfer learning** using both **VGG16** and **ResNet50** pre-trained models
- **Prepared and preprocessed image data** for deep learning tasks
- **Fine-tuned** pre-trained models for a specific classification problem
- **Evaluated and compared** the performance of different model architectures
- Gained practical experience with the **Keras** and **TensorFlow** frameworks

## ðŸ›  **Technologies & Tools Used**  
- **Python**  
  - Libraries: TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib  
- **Jupyter Notebook** (for coding and experimentation)  
- **Pre-Trained Models**:
  - VGG16 (Visual Geometry Group)
  - ResNet50 (Residual Network)
- **Image Data** (for classification tasks)
