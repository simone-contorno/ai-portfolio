# **Classify Waste Products Using Transfer Learning**

## ðŸ“Œ **Project Overview**  
This notebook is designed to practice and apply the knowledge I got from the **Deep Learning with Keras and Tensorflow** course by IBM on Coursera.
The goal is to develop an AI-powered solution to classify waste products into recyclable and organic categories using **transfer learning**. The project focuses on utilizing the pre-trained **VGG16 model** for image recognition and classification, aiming to enhance the efficiency of waste management systems in GreenCity. 
The final output of this project will be a trained model capable of distinguishing between recyclable and organic waste based on images.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Learning Objectives**  
By completing this project, I:
- Applied **transfer learning** using the **VGG16** model for image classification.
- **Prepared and preprocessed image data** for machine learning tasks.
- **Fine-tuned** a pre-trained model to improve classification accuracy.
- **Evaluated** the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
- Visualized **model predictions** on test data to assess the model's effectiveness.
