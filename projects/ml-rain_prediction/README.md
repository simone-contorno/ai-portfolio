# **Rain Prediction**

## ðŸ“Œ **Project Overview**  
This notebook is designed to practice and apply the classification algorithms I have learned in the **Machine Learning with Python** course by IBM on Coursera. The goal is to create various classification models using different algorithms, evaluate them using multiple metrics, and provide a detailed report on the model performances.

In this project, I:
- Implemented various classification algorithms
- Evaluated model performance using a set of evaluation metrics
- Gained hands-on experience in the classification process

## ðŸŽ¯ **Objectives**  
- **Implement** the following classification algorithms:
  1. Linear Regression  
  2. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
  3. Decision Trees  
  4. Logistic Regression  
  5. Support Vector Machines (SVM)  
- **Evaluate** the models using a variety of performance metrics:
  1. Accuracy Score  
  2. Jaccard Index  
  3. F1-Score  
  4. LogLoss  
  5. Mean Absolute Error  
  6. Mean Squared Error  
  7. R2-Score  
- **Generate a comprehensive report** summarizing model performance and insights.

## ðŸ›  **Technologies & Tools Used**  
- **Python**  
  - Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Jupyter Notebook** (for experimentation and model evaluation)  
- **Classification Models**: Linear Regression, KNN, Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, SVM
