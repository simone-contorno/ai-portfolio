# **League of Legends Match Predictor**

## ðŸ“Œ **Project Overview**  
This notebook is designed to practice and apply the knowledge I gained from the **Introduction to Neural Networks and PyTorch** course by IBM on Coursera. The project focuses on building a logistic regression model to predict the outcomes of League of Legends matches, a popular multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game.

In this project, I:
- Implemented a logistic regression model using PyTorch
- Applied optimization techniques like L2 regularization
- Evaluated model performance using accuracy metrics and visualization tools
- Gained hands-on experience with neural networks and PyTorch fundamentals

## ðŸŽ¯ **Objectives**  
- **Load and preprocess** League of Legends match data for machine learning
- **Implement** a logistic regression model using PyTorch's functionalities
- **Train** the model using gradient descent for optimization
- **Apply** L2 regularization to prevent overfitting
- **Evaluate** model performance using accuracy metrics, confusion matrices, and ROC curves
- **Visualize** and interpret the results to gain insights into model behavior

## ðŸ›  **Technologies & Tools Used**  
- **Python**  
  - Libraries: PyTorch, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn  
- **Jupyter Notebook** (for coding and experimentation)  
- **Machine Learning Techniques**:
